This talk by Stephen Haffner wants to help make you a better Linux user! It will start with some quick tips on using the command line more efficiently, provide an overview of the organization of a Linux system, and finish up with a smattering of useful file, networking, and security tools available on most distributions.

As always there will be pizza and laptops are encouraged.
