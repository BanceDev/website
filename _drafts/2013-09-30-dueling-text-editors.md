This Thursday, 2013/10/03 at 7pm, in Caldwell Labs 120, Daniel Thau and Maxim Kim will present text editors Vim and Emacs, compare their features, challenge each other to Mortal Kombat. If you want to talk about your favorite editor too let us know at <a href="mailto:meetings%40opensource.osu.edu" class="spamspan">meetings@opensource.osu.edu</a>. 

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
