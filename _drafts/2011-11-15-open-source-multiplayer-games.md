Hello all,

Come join me this Thursday at we take a tour of several open source multiplayer games we are going to be playing this Saturday at our LAN party!

I will demonstrate several games we will be playing, live! If you have a laptop capable of running the games, feel free to bring it along and battle me live mano-a-mano as I demonstrate the games.

The short list of games I intent to demonstrate are below. Games may be added or removed from the list until the LAN Party.
