We are having a PGP Signing Party on January 13, 2011 and everyone is invited. This will be where people can show up and have other people in the area verify who you are and sign your PGP key if they choose to.
<br><br>
We'll try to follow this form of a PGP signing party: <a href="http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html#traditional">Informal / Traditional</a>
We will have the PGP signing party after our regularly scheduled meeting. Our regularly scheduled meetings start at 7:00PM and usually last about an hour or two. Our topic for that night will be GIMP. Also we usually have pizza sometime between 7:30PM and 8:30PM depending on when there is a good 'break' point in the presentation.
<br><br>
Also if you would like to contact us a bit faster or want to contact multiple people from the club as well; we have an IRC presence. We are in #osu_osc on <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net">irc.freenode.net</a>
