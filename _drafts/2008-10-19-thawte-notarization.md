<p>This week we will meet on <!--date goes here--> at <!--time goes here--> in <!--alternate location goes here--><a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 266. Please note that this is <b>not</b> the time/date we normally meet. We have a special guest, <a href="https://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a> notary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_M._Noble">Mark Noble</a>, who will present on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-certificates/free-guides-whitepapers/pdf/wot_eng.pdf" onClick="window.open('https://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-certificates/free-guides-whitepapers/pdf/wot_eng.pdf','_blank','toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes, copyhistory=no, width=650, height=768'); return false;">Thawte Web of Trust</a> and helping us to obtain our own personal e-mail certificates. Those who come and bring 2 forms of photo identification will get their own personalized e-mail certificates. (<a href="/thawte_wot">read more</a>)</p>
<!--break-->
<p>If you would like a certified certificate, it will be appreciated if you come prepared. Before coming, please <a href="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/personal-email-certificates/index.html" title="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/personal-email-certificates/index.html" onClick="window.open('https://www.thawte.com/cgi/enroll/personal/step1.exe','_blank','toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes, copyhistory=no, width=516, height=500');return false;
">sign up</a> for Thawte's Freemail program. This will give you access to unlimited security certificates for your all your e-mail accounts, but with "<i>Thawte Freemail Member</i>" as the bearer's name.</p>

<p>In order to add your name, you'll need to get it <a href="https://www.thawte.com/cgi/personal/wot/contents.exe" title="https://www.thawte.com/cgi/personal/wot/contents.exe - Login Required" onClick="if(!confirm('You must already have registered with Thawte in order to access this page.')){return false;}">notarized</a> by several Thawte notaries. You <b><u><font color="#ff0000">MUST</font></u></b> meet the notary in person for him/her to assert your identity, where you will sign a paper asserting your identity and provide <a href="http://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/wot_validation.html" title="http://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/wot_validation.html">government-issued photo identification</a>. Since there are not many notaries in any given region (note that a <a href="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/wot_rules.html" title="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/wot_rules.html">Thawte notary</a> is different from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public" title="Public Notary - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">public notary</a>), this can be a difficult and drawn-out process. Therefore, we will have notaries with enough <a href="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/wot_points.html">points</a> to assert your identity to Thawte by the end of the meeting, and this is not a meeting to miss.</p>

<p>While you can <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_an_SMIME_certificate#Self-signed_certificates">create your own</a> certificate, in order for other people to recognize it you will need to have it certified by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authority</a> (CA), one of which is Thawte. Unlike other certificate authorities, Thawte is providing these e-mail certificates for free. Instead of meeting actual company representatives, you are meeting other Thawte Freemail members who have asserted their own identity, and having them assert you to Thawte in a setup similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust" title="Web of Trust - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">GPG/PGP Web of Trust</a>. Once you register, you can obtain and renew unlimited security certificates for as many e-mail addresses as you like for a lifetime, and once your identity is asserted they will (at your option) contain your name.</p>

<p>For a quick overview, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME" title="S/MIME - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">S/MIME</a> is an e-mail implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" title="Public-key cryptography - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">public key cryptography</a>, which allows for message integrity and privacy. In public-key cryptography, a message can be encrypted using your public key, but can only be un-ecrypted with the private key which you keep on your computer, ensuring that if someone encrypts a message to you, only you will be able to read it. To validate the source of the message, you can use your private key to generate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" title="Digital signature, Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">digital signature</a>, which will serve as legal and matematical proof that you sent the e-mail and the message has not been altered since it left your machine.</p>
