  This past summer, p0rn and pharmaceutical spammers had a field day, then our website

After months of returning error messages to users who went to opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum, the <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum" title="Click here to enter our forums">Open Source Club forums</a> are back online. This past summer, p0rn and pharmaceutical spammers had a field day, then our website got taken offline and we had to disable forums and comments. We have cleaned up some lingering spam comments, re-enabled the forum, and added a captcha requirement in order for anyone to log in, as well as a few other random things.

Spamming in the forums will absolutely not be tolerated. If you find any spam on this site, please report it <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum/21">here</a> and a moderator will delete it and block/delete the offending user's account.

For the time being, only *.edu e-mail addresses may register, but if you have a current account with another address that you already registered then it should still be active. If you do not have a *.edu address and would like access to the forum, you can <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/contact" title="Contact us">contact me</a> or another administrator telling us your e-mail address before you try to create the account so we can authorize it. <u>Please</u> only do this if you do not have a *.edu address. Otherwise, we ask that you use your school address for registering. We use this to keep track of users (e.g. someone with a name.#@osu.edu is less likely to be a spammer than admin@viagra.com or cmbb@dbx.hk) and to restrict spammers from creating accounts just to hose the page with inappropriate content.
