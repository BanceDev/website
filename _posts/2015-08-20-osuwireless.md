Steps will vary depending on your distro of choice, but the same principles apply:

*   authentication: Protected EAP (PEAP)
*   inner authentication: MSCHAPv2
*   username: `name.#`
*   password: `foo`

*You may (optionally) specify the path to the root certificate as it's supposed to combat man-in-the-middle attacks.*
