Our last meeting (Nov 15) was about the Open Handset Alliance's Android. A mobile operation system and application stack. We had a demo with the Hello World / Hello Android and spent alot of the time playing with the emulator prototype. Because I feel this is a very interesting development, I personally will be working on creating some apps for the platform. In addition, Google has $10M in prizes for developers who create interesting new applications for this platform.<object width="470" height="406"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/p/5CE8623916B0E2FF"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/p/5CE8623916B0E2FF" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="470" height="406" wmode="transparent"></object>
