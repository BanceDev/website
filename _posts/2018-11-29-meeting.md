      After getting [shunned by the Librem community](https://news.softpedia.com/news/purism-s-privacy-focused-librem-5-linux-phone-will-ship-with-gnome-3-32-desktop-523192.shtml), KDE collaborates with Necuno Solutions to offer Plasma Mobile.

      Necuno Solutions is working with open source mobile communities and intends to make their hardware a welcoming platform for Free and open source operating systems in the mobile ecosystem.

      > KDE has reached very far in the mobile ecosystem by leveraging the power of the community. We feel that KDE is in a good position to challenge the duopoly in the future. This will be a new innovative approach to combine truly open source hardware with a truly open source operating system"

      > _--Tanja Drca, Chief Communications Officer at Necuno Solutions_

      > It is important that developers within the mobile ecosystem are able to work with open devices which are easy to modify and tweak, and not locked by vendors to a particular operating system. Necuno Solutions is working on one such device and will ultimately help improve Plasma Mobile due to its open nature."
