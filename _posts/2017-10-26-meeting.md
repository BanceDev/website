        - ME is a separate processor embedded in the chipset of any modern computer with an Intel CPU
        - ME runs even when the computer is sleeping or powered off
        - The most recent version of ME is 11. Older versions of ME were based on the ARCtangent/ARCompact/SPARC architecture, but version 11 is x86-based.

        > In addition, when we looked inside the decompressed vfs module, we encountered the strings “FS: bogus child for forking” and “FS: forking on top of in-use child,” which clearly originate from Minix3 code. It would seem that ME 11 is based on the MINIX 3 OS developed by Andrew Tanenbaum :)

        - What's the more popular OS - Minix or Linux?

        - Researchers discovered "a mechanism that can disable Intel ME after hardware is initialized and the main processor starts."
        > Intel ME has access to almost all data on the computer. The ability to execute third-party code on Intel ME would allow for a complete compromise of the platform.

        > ...previously, ThreadX RTOS had been used. Now ME firmware includes a full-fledged operating system with processes, threads, memory manager, hardware bus driver, file system, and many other components.

        > One of the fields, called "reserve_hap", drew our attention because there was a comment next to it: "High Assurance Platform (HAP) enable"
        > The second search result said that the name belongs to a trusted platform program linked to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). A graphics-rich presentation describing the program can be found [here](http://fm.csl.sri.com/LAW/2009/dobry-law09-HAP-Challenges.pdf).

        > So we have found an undocumented PCH strap that can be used to switch on a special mode disabling the main Intel ME functionality at an early stage.

        > Intel representatives have been informed about the details of our research. Their response has confirmed our hypothesis about the connection of the undocumented mode with the High Assurance Platform program. With their permission, we quote Intel's answer below:

        > >Mark/Maxim,

        > > In response to requests from customers with specialized requirements we sometimes explore the modification or disabling of certain features. In this case, the modifications were made at the request of equipment manufacturers in support of their customer’s evaluation of the US government’s “High Assurance Platform” program.  These modifications underwent a limited validation cycle and are not an officially supported configuration.

        > Disabling the Management Engine, long believed to be impossible, is now possible and available in all current Librem laptops, it is also available as a software update for previously shipped recent Librem laptops.

        > Purism, because it runs coreboot and maintains its own BIOS firmware update process has been able to release and ship coreboot that disables the Management Engine from running, directly halting the ME CPU without the ability of recovery.

        > Purism, in the long-term pursuit of liberating hardware at the lowest levels, still has more work to do. Removing the management engine entirely is the next step beyond just disabling it. Coreboot also includes another binary, the Intel FSP, a less worrisome but still important binary to liberate, incorporating a free vBIOS is another step Purism plans to take. The road to a completely free system on current Intel CPUs is not over, but the largest step of disabling the Management Engine is arguably the largest milestone to cross.
