This Thursday [2/19/09] we'll be taking apart an Xbox 360 and looking at its insides. I'll also be showing how I did some mods to make my Xbox look a little sexier. By the end of this meeting you'll have all the knowledge you need to go home and void your warranty!

As always, the meeting will be at 7pm in Dreese 266.
