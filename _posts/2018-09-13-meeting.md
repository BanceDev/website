      > The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails) is a Debian-based live DVD/USB with the goal of providing complete Internet anonymity for the user. The product ships with several Internet applications, including web browser, IRC client, mail client and instant messenger, all pre-configured with security in mind and with all traffic anonymised. To achieve this, Incognito uses the Tor network to make Internet traffic very hard to trace.

    notes: |
      > The biggest Wi-Fi security update in 14 years was recently unveiled by the Wi-Fi Alliance. The Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) security certificate protocol provides some much-needed updates to the WPA2 protocol introduced in 2004. Rather than a wholesale reworking of Wi-Fi security, WPA3 is focused on bringing new techniques to bear against the cracks that have begun to show in WPA2.

      ## Notable Features:
        - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
        - 192-bit encryption protocols
        - Easy Connect
        - Enhanced Open

    notes: |
      > The FU540-C000, which is available on the HiFive Unleashed development board, is a Linux capable board based on the open source Freedom platform.

      > At SiFive we believe that open source hardware is the way of the future, but these sorts of industry-wide shifts happen incrementally instead of all at once.

      > Today we’re [...] releasing the FU540-C000’s ZSBL and FSBL as an open source project, which can be found on GitHub like all of SiFive’s other open source projects.

      [Freedom Bootloader Source Code](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-u540-c000-bootloader)

      >  The code is all licensed under the Apache 2.0 license so it can easily be imported into U-Boot, CoreBoot, TianoCore, etc.
