        - No advertiser will be able to promote things like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings - ICOs for short - or binary options.
        - Ads that violate the company's new policy will be banned on Facebook's core app
        - It’s a new but “intentionally broad” policy, while the social network figures out how to better deal with scams.

        >We believe this acquisition cements Red Hat as a cornerstone of hybrid cloud and modern app deployments.
          - Paul Cormierpresident, Products and Technologies, Red Hat

        - Founded in 2013, CoreOS was created with a goal of building and delivering infrastructure for organizations of all sizes that mirrored that of large-scale software companies, automatically updating and patching servers and helping to solve pain points like downtime, security and resilience.

        - Red Hat was early to embrace containers and container orchestration and has contributed deeply to related open source communities, including Kubernetes, where it is the second-leading contributor behind only Google.

        - The transaction is expected to close in January 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.
