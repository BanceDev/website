      ## Embrace, Extend, Extinguish
      
      Why is Open Source immune to this?

      > Microsoft itself is a user of open source technologies

      Yes, but specifically the Linux _kernel_, and technology that is written by companies who shall remain nameless but have recently be acquired.

      > It’s naive to think that companies like Red Hat, Google, Facebook, SUSE, Canonical, IBM, etc. will let Microsoft hijack their project.

      Hijacking is not one of the "triple E's".

      > [...] you can always fork the project and regain control.

      Unless that fork contains [patented code **only available to members**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-open-sources-its-entire-patent-portfolio/) as discussed last week.

      - GitHub might develop a preferential treatment for Microsoft tools and technologies.
      - Microsoft can’t be trusted given its past
        - If they're a "different company", then why are they using the same name?
      - Github _remains_ proprietary, closed source software. **Show me the code**.
