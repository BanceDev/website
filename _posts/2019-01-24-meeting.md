  - title: "NetBSD hits 100% reproducibility in builds"
    link: 'https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/netbsd/netbsd.html'
    notes: |
      > _Reproducible builds_ enable anyone to reproduce bit by bit identical binary packages from a given source, so that anyone can verify that a given binary derived from the source it was said to be derived.

      Example variables:
      - `env LANG`
      - `env PATH`
      - kernel version
      - datetime
      - CPU type

      > The idea that open source software is unlikely to contain malware because you can see the source code yourself has been a consistent marketing point for years. [...] The flaw in this thought process of course is that 99.99% of us are not compiling the source ourselves. [...] Unfortunately it's not that easy with most software. Different compilers, different compiler flags, different build environments, and in some cases straight up non-deterministic parts of the build process leave artifacts everywhere to the point that it's very likely that every single build is different. This then allows us to close the trust gap because we can now verify that other people are getting the same binary as is in the distro/vendor package and see that it has not been modified.

      > Let me briefly tell my Linux story. If you’re thinking about moving to Linux, and wondering how you’d do so, it might give you some pointers and inspiration.

      Larry Sanger is the co-founder of Wikipedia. In this article he discusses how he started using Linux on a day-to-day basis on his desktops in his personal and professional life. He also gives a couple pointers on how to do it if you want to follow his lead! In short:

      1. Install Ubuntu in Virtualbox
      2. Install your favorite browser and email client
      3. ???
      4. Profit

      If you don't like it, try another distro.
