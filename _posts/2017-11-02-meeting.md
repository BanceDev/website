          Rome is putting in to place policies to avoid vendor lock-in using open-source software.
          >In 2018, Rome will run a pilot to test the use of workstations running Linux. Some of the IT support staff already have much experience with Linux servers and workstations, which should help resolve possible issues with network drives, shared folders and peripherals such as printers.
         >Rome’s IT department is supporting the city council’s wish to get rid of IT vendor lock-in, says Ms Colasanti, “We are working together closely, for without their support, change won’t happen.”
        >Commencement of the switch to open source was announced by the city in early September. "Currently, about one-third of our IT spending is distributed among just six IT vendors, some of which have been operating within the administration for more than three decades", the announcement quotes Councillor Flavia Marzano as saying. "Our choice to implement free software intends to end the oligarchy in this industry.”
        >Rome’s city council decided to switch to open source in October 2016.

         >On the road to a working mobile phone, doing some initial evaluation and testing of the current state of existing user interfaces and frameworks is key, to evaluate what can readily serve as building blocks and what needs work. Last weekend I did an initial experiment in getting Plasma Mobile working on our i.MX 6 based test development board, using a 4.13.5 Linux kernel and stock Debian Testing. Initially, I encountered a few problems with KWin not wanting to start a Wayland compositor due to not recognizing the device as OpenGL ES 2.0 capable and also not finding a few needed OpenGL extensions. After some digging and with help from Plasma Mobile developer Bhushan Shah we tracked this issue down to a bug in libepoxy that was solved a long time ago. Unfortunately, Debian’s packaged version of this library was very old, so I upgraded it to a newer version manually (and we will get it updated in Debian soon). This resulted in a working Plasma Shell on the device...
         >...In general, Plasma Mobile already provides a usable (albeit alpha-quality) mobile interface today. The Qt Quick/QML based Kirigami component library and interface guidelines also provide a nice framework for mobile application developers, that have been tested on Android as well, and works nicely on and with the Plasma Mobile shell.

         Not open source news, as it only affects machines running windows, but vulnerabilities are important to watch for.
