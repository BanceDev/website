We had our first meeting for the quarter in Dreese Labs room 266 at 7:00 pm. Meetings end whenever they end, with no specific time. No absolute topic was decided on, so we discussed a few random things, such as South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone streaming <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/south-park-to-o.html">South Park online</a> for free (where we legally watched a recent episode from Season 12, which <a href="/images/southpark.png" target="_blank"><strong>does</strong> play in Linux</a> without DRM hacks), Adobe creating a web-based free express (and watered down) version of <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/">Photoshop</a>, we also spent a few minutes sharing our web-development views. The meeting was open to students and non-students alike, and pizza was served as always. Altogether we had a great turnout and I look forward to a similar turnout at our next meeting.
