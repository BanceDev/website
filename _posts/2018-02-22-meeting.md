  - title: "Secure By Default: Disk Encryption"
    link: 'https://medium.com/elementaryos/secure-by-default-disk-encryption-3592bf25e3ce'
    notes: |
      > [Full Disk Encryption] is a user-selectable feature both elementary OS and [System76's] Pop!_OS have shipped via the Ubiquity installer since it debuted, but it’s always been off by default and poorly communicated. We aim to change that.

      > [...] frankly it’s just good practice to encrypt by default

      > Our mantra for the new installer is that "every install is an OEM install." 

      > For a user installing the OS for themself from a flash drive — what I'll call a user installation - they just step through the OEM-like portion, then step through user setup. For OEMs, they perform the first part the installation, then can power off the device and ship it to a user. The end user then receives the machine, sets up their user, and is off to work.

    notes: |
      > RISC-V chipmaker SiFive has surprised the open-source community again by unveiling a full development board built around the ISA.

      > The development board itself features a 8GB of DDR4 with ECC, a gigabit ethernet port, 32 MB of quad SPI flash memory, a MicroSD card slot, and an FPGA mezzanine card (FMC) connector for allowing peripherals and other expansion devices to be attached to the board.

    notes: |
      - ARM (the company) has an integrated component called an iSIM that's built into the same chip as the processor
      - iSIM will take up a "fraction of a millimeter squared"
      - This is being developed for small IoT devices
