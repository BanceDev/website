      ## Microsoft Creates Is Own Version of Linux for the First Time

      Microsoft has introduced Azure Sphere, a technology that will revamp the security of microprocessors that powers the smart appliances.

      Microsoft has adopted a combined approach through Azure Sphere which uses hardware, software and the cloud to secure internet-connected devices. The following are the three components used in it:

      ## Azure Sphere certified microcontrollers (MCUs)

      First is the new class of microcontrollers (MCUs) that combines both real-time and application processors with built-in Microsoft security technology and connectivity. The company will provide this powerful microprocessor’s design to chip manufacturers for free.

      ## Azure Sphere OS

      A new operating system, Azure Sphere, is Microsoft’s first Linux-based OS that will run on the chips. This customized Linux kernel will provide a secure platform through its Windows-inspired security features that can be scaled down to run on smaller systems.

      ## Azure Sphere Security Service

      The system is integrated with an Azure Sphere cloud service that will detect security issues, update software with security patches and facilitate a secure connection between devices and the cloud.

      # Today, Netflix is open-sourcing Titus, their container management platform.

      - Container use at Netflix has grown from thousands of containers launched per week to as many as three million containers launched per week in April 2018

      > It was clear that we were discussing ideas, problems, and solutions that resonated with those at a variety of companies, both large and small. We hope that by sharing Titus we are able to help accelerate like-minded teams, and to bring the lessons we've learned forward in the container management community.

      Works almost _exclusively_ with Amazon AWS, leveraging many of it's APIs and integrations internally.
