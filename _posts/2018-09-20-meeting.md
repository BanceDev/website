      After being approached for an [article](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside)
      about his behavior from The New Yorker, Linus Torvalds announced that he was temporarily taking a break from development on the
      Linux kernel, and left an apology to those hurt by his words.

      >  I am not an emotionally empathetic kind of person and that probably doesn't come as a big surprise to anybody.  Least of all me.  The fact that I then misread people and don't realize (for years) how badly I've judged a situation and contributed to an unprofessional environment is not good.

      > This week people in our community confronted me about my lifetime of not understanding emotions.  My flippant attacks in emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for.  Especially at times when I made it personal.  In my quest for a better patch, this made sense to me. I know now this was not OK and I am truly sorry.

      Linus is infamous for his rants on the mailing list. In one such rant he suggested that someone be "retroactively aborted".

      > Of course, I'd also suggest that whoever was the genius who thought it was a good idea to read things ONE F*CKING BYTE AT A TIME with system calls for each byte should be retroactively aborted. Who the f*ck does idiotic things like that? How did they noty die as babies, considering that they were likely too stupid to find a tit to suck on?

      Though he will be taking a break, Linus does not intend to stop working on Linux for good.

      > This is not some kind of "I'm burnt out, I need to just go away" break.  I'm not feeling like I don't want to continue maintaining Linux. Quite the reverse.  I very much *do* want to continue to do this project that I've been working on for almost three decades.

      > This is more like the time I got out of kernel development for a while because I needed to write a little tool called "git".  I need to take a break to get help on how to behave differently and fix some issues in my tooling and workflow.

      > Our goal this year is to make it possible for the team to focus on one thing only: stability. Our previous fundraisers were all about features: adding new features, extending existing features. Thanks to your help, Krita has grown at a break-neck speed! But writing new code is only half the story. This time, we want to focus on squashing bugs and stabilizing the new code. And sometimes things aren’t out-and-out broken, but unpleasant to work with. A bit uglier than needed. More cumbersome than you’d like. That needs fixing as well!

      ## Why They Need Fundraising

      > We have many enthusiastic supporters who donate to Krita through the development fund, or when they download Krita. That’s awesome! But we need an extra push so we can keep funding Dmitry, Boudewijn and Jouni, and who knows? Maybe we’ll be able to grow the team, too, with your help. The money we raise will go directly to the developers to keep improving the program!

      > These developers also help the Krita wider community and mentor new programmers. The community of volunteer contributor does a lot of great work on the website, manual, bug triaging, community support, as well as improving the program. By having a stable core of people funded to work on Krita, the entire community gets stronger and stronger.
