      # Major Changes

      - Can now use unified cgroup hierarchy, cgroupsfs and cgmanager are deprecated
      - Some new templates (notably OCI, so you can pull from docker hub)
      - Seccomp filtering based on argument (not just white and black lists anymore!)
      - You can directly run an app in a container without an init process in between
      - LXC removes the legacy template-based container build system in favor of the new project [distrobuilder](https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder). For detailed information you can read this [blogpost](https://brauner.github.io/2018/02/27/lxc-removes-legacy-template-build-system.html).
      - The LXC tools now support passing the container name without the -n command line flag

      # Preconceptions
      - Creating personal projects from scratch is better experience than contributing to an existing open source project.
      - My coding skills just won't cut it.
      - Proprietary software firms do better work than open source software organizations.
