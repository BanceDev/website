      # [elementary OS 5.0](https://medium.com/@cassidyjames/471dfdedc7b3)

      > elementary OS is an Ubuntu-based desktop distribution. Some of its more interesting features include a custom desktop environment called Pantheon and many custom apps including Photos, Music, Videos, Calendar, Terminal, Files, and more. It also comes with some familiar apps like the Epiphany web browser and a fork of Geary mail.

      # [OpenBSD 6.4](https://www.openbsd.org/64.html)

      - The most interesting feature is the `unveil()` system call which allows applications to sandbox themselves, blocking their own access to the file system. This is especially useful for programs which operate on unknown data which may try to exploit or crash the application:

      > New `unveil(2)` system call to restrict file system access of the calling process to the specified files and directories. It is most powerful when properly combined with privilege separation and `pledge(2)`

    notes: |
      > Today, the maker of another open source database, MongoDB, plans to introduce a license of its own to deal with the issue cited by Redis: cloud service providers that sell hosted versions of open-source programs – such as Redis and MongoDB database servers – without offering anything in return.
      > MongoDB has introduced a new license called the Server Side Public License (SSPL), and declared that all versions of MongoDB's Community Server released henceforth, including patch fixes for prior versions, will be governed by the SSPL.
    
      > What's different is Section 13, which says that if you offer SSPL software as a service, you have to make available not only the software source code and modifications, if any, but also the source code of the applications used to run the service.

      > I feel the underlying motivation for such a clause is orthogonal to the motivation behind the open source and libre software movements in general. Free, libre and open source software has long accepted the 'four freedoms' as their defining conditions. These are freedoms the author grants to the recipient, not requirements imposed to benefit the authors and the community directly
      >
      > This seems to imply that I cannot run the software on any cloud provider I am aware of I'm not even sure there is an accessible OpenStack provider that I have full access to their entire stack including hosted modifications. It would seem that in order for me to deploy an application on AWS under this license, I would need to release all of AWS, which of course is impossible as I am not Amazon.
