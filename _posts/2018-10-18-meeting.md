      # [elementary OS 5.0](https://medium.com/@cassidyjames/471dfdedc7b3)

      > elementary OS is an Ubuntu-based desktop distribution. Some of its more interesting features include a custom desktop environment called Pantheon and many custom apps including Photos, Music, Videos, Calendar, Terminal, Files, and more. It also comes with some familiar apps like the Epiphany web browser and a fork of Geary mail.

    notes: |
      > Today, the maker of another open source database, MongoDB, plans to introduce a license of its own to deal with the issue cited by Redis: cloud service providers that sell hosted versions of open-source programs – such as Redis and MongoDB database servers – without offering anything in return.
      > MongoDB has introduced a new license called the Server Side Public License (SSPL), and declared that all versions of MongoDB's Community Server released henceforth, including patch fixes for prior versions, will be governed by the SSPL.
