We are meeting tonight (Thursday, February 28th) at <strong>6:00 pm</strong> in <strong>Scott Lab room 103</strong>. Please note that this is not the normal time/location we meet. We are meeting <strong>one hour before</strong> our normal meeting time, and in <strong>Scott Lab</strong> instead of Dreese Lab. Our guest speaker, Jim Muir, is a nuclear and mechanical engineering who had better write solid code, and this presentation could be volatile, so we can just let Scott Labs bear this one. Jim Muir is speaking to us about a new open source content management system called SilverStripe. Pizza will be served and as always everyone is welcome.
