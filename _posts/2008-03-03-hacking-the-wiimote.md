Last week, we had a really good turnout and watched some demos of <a href="http://www.usmechatronics.com/usmgarage/WiiBot.html">hacking the Nintendo Wii remote</a> to create your own virtual 3-D environment in relative to your perspective, along with a few other slick <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/65" target="_blank">multi-touch-screen interfaces</a>, bordering on making keyboards obsolete. We had a really great turnout and are considering doing it in the future. More information is yet to come...

There is also some talk about hacking the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PCEEE" title="ASUS Eee PC - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">Eee</a>, a $500 child-sized laptop similar to the <a href="http://laptop.org/laptop/" title="One Laptop per Child">OX</a> (One Laptop per Child campaign) with Linux pre-installed that, for the price, has some pretty impressive hardware specs, and I might add it is very light-weight.
