      - Mozilla today announced that Firefox will soon block web trackers by default. 

      - Three features will be integrated by default:
        - Block trackers that slow down page loads (FF 63: Oct. 2018)
        - Remove cross-site tracking (FF 65: Jan. 2019)
        - Mitigate fingerprinting and cryptomining (???)

      - Ads that donâ€™t track you are allowed through

      - Most likely going to use [Disconnect.me Blacklist](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection#w_block-lists-in-firefox)

      - Now what about `out.reddit.com`...?

      > When you have complexity you can't manage it in a closed environment,  you need to have the people that actually find problems and give them the ability to get involved and help you to fix them. It's a complicated world and the only way to deal with complexity is the open exchange of ideas.

      _Remember this during your capstone projects._
