      ## What was Palm webOS nearly a decade ago is seeing its latest incarnation as LG webOS Open-Source Edition.

      1. HP acquired Palm in 2010
      2. HP announced they would publish webOS source code as "Open webOS" used in:
        - smart TVs
        - IoT devices

      > In cooperation with South Korea's [NIPA](http://www.nipa.kr/eng/main.it), [LG] is working on making webOS suitable as a more open platform with open connectivity.

      # Private Internet Access may be the most well-known VPN service provider in the US today

      > we have started the process of open sourcing our software, and over the next six months we will be releasing the source code for all our client-side applications, as well as libraries and extensions.
      >
      > We believe that the shift to open source is the right move for a privacy-focused business, and recognise that code transparency is key.
      >
      > **We appreciate that our code may not be perfect**, and we hope that the wider FOSS community will get involved, provide feedback, feature requests, bug fixes and generally help provide a greater service to the wider privacy movement.
