      ## Filesytems Previously supported
        - `xfs`
        - `ext3`
        - encrypted `ext4`

      ## Possible alternatives:
        - [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)
        - [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)
        - `rsync -ave ssh`

      Full luks-type disk encryption _should_ still be supported. See [Linux Unplugged #262](http://linuxunplugged.com/262) for more discussion.

      > "The [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) has been engaging with Tesla on its GPL compliance since June 2013, when we advised Tesla that we had received multiple reports of a GPL violation regarding Tesla's Model S. Customers who purchased Tesla's Model S received on-board system(s) that contained BusyBox and Linux, but did not receive any source code, nor an offer for the source.
      >
      > ...This part of the process is the longest, most difficult part of GPL enforcement. We often wish we could celebrate the triumph of moving from a no-source-or-offer violation to the next step of 'incomplete sources provided'. However, we also can't lose sight of the fact that compliance means meeting all GPL's requirements, so we don't convey false hopes with an incomplete release. We must ultimately remain focused on user freedom in our efforts.

      - YouTube's Polymer redesign relies on the deprecated Shadow DOM v0 API only implemented in Chrome
      - Pre-Polymer design can be restored via FF "Youtube Classic" extension
