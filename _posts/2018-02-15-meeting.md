  - title: "Encryption keeps us safe. It must not be compromised with 'backdoors'"

      # There have been those who called for backdoored encryption:

      > The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, has called for "responsible encryption" that would allow officials to unlock encrypted data with a warrant.
      > Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, recently said that lack of access to encrypted smartphones was a "major public safety issue".
      > In the UK, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, has repeatedly said that encryption is a "problem"
      >
      > But for companies to simply create a backdoor - a special set of keys that allow law enforcement to "unlock" encrypted communications of suspected criminals - would be wrong.
      >
      > Almost every aspect of our lives - our finances, our identities, our conversations with loved ones - are stored online. The stakes of theft are high for everyone, every day. The same way we need locks for our cars and our doors, have vaults in our banks and security personnel in our buildings, we need encryption to protect our data.
      > Last summer, a yet-to-be-identified group nicknamed the Shadow Brokers gained access to some of the NSA’s most highly classified and potent hacking tools. Imagine if they had been a set of keys into every encryption protocol out there. And then ask if it’s realistic to assume that anyone could keep such keys secure, particularly given the track record of nation states compromising the highest levels of corporate and government security.
      >
      > If the UK or US governments are entitled to open this backdoor to stop dangerous criminals, why not the People’s Republic of China, or the Russian Federation, who could also conveniently monitor dissidents?
