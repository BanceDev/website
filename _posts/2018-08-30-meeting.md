      > More than 3000 of the games that have been added to Steam after [2010] have included Linux support, with more titles being added every day.

      > [Valve is] releasing the Beta of a new and improved version of Steam Play to all Linux users! It includes a modified distribution of Wine, called Proton, to provide compatibility with Windows game titles.

      [Proton Github Repo](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/)

      ### Q: Are there any games that will never work with Proton?

      ### It's likely that some games using complex DRM or anti-cheat systems will be difficult, or even impossible to support.

      > It is the first election system of its kind, using publicly available source code that has been certified for use in California.

      > [...] uses open source software developed by local officials and design experts.

      [The nation's biggest county is developing a new platform for counting ballots. Just don't go looking for the source code right away.](https://statescoop.com/los-angeles-countys-new-open-source-vote-tallying-system-isnt-open-source-just-yet)

      > My takeaway is that their intention is to make it freely available to other organizations, but today it's not. It's open source in the sense that it was paid for by public funds and the intent is to share it.

      In 2016, New Hampshire introduced a vote-casting and -tabulation system for blind voters called called "one4all," which is based on software first created by researchers at the University of Florida. That system, called [Prime III](https://github.com/HXRL/Prime-III) by the Florida developers, is also being reviewed by officials in Ohio.

      LA County's Board of Elections did not respond to questions about when it plans to share its source code or review potential collaborators

      > ## Problem description
      > 
      > Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows cannot be downloaded without logging into Docker Store.
      > 
      > ## Problem location
      > 
      > I saw a problem on the following URL: Install Docker for Mac and Install Docker for Windows
      > 
      > ## Suggestions for a fix
      > 
      > It would be awesome if Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows could be downloaded without logging into Docker Store as not to make users jump through hoops. This was already previously possible, if I remember correctly.

      > Uhuh. You mean, force people to login with an email so we can target them with an ad campaign so we make money??
      >
      > This feels dishonest. If you're trying to make money, say so. 'improve user experience' is the oldest, lamest excuse in the book...
      >
      > You just made the 'user experience' suck by putting it behind a login-wall. One click installers are not new...and you don't need e-mail specific identifiers to collect install logs. I'm calling a giant load of baloney on this one.
