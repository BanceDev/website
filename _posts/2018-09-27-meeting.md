      ## Security

      - Video Verification
      - 2FA provider ('gateway')

      ## Collaboration

      >You don't share a document simply for somebody else to download it, you want them to give you feedback on it, or make changes!
      
      - Attach notes to shares
      - Search for files by content of comments
      - Recover accidentally deleted shares

      ## Federation

      - Share between nextcloud servers:
        - Groups
        - Calendars
        - Contacts
        - Talk video call

      And Lots and lots more points!

      >The Nextcloud Groupware suite introduces resource booking in the calendar app. A major area of improvement has been the Deck app, a digital Kanban board, which has now officially been added to Nextcloud Groupware. It features integration with Nextcloud Files and offers an easy to use tool for teams to plan their projects.

      Possible G-suite replacement???

      >Today we're excited to introduce Cloudflare's IPFS Gateway, an easy way to access content from the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) that doesn't require installing and running any special software on your computer.
      >
      > [blog.cloudflare.com](https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/)

      >IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
      >
      >IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects. You can read more about its origins in the paper IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System.
      >
      >IPFS is becoming a new major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even more. It sounds crazy. It is crazy.
