Thursday, 2015-01-29 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace and George Kvaratskhelia will preset "Python".

This talk will cover the basics of the language, from basic syntax and datatypes to the interpreter. At the end, George will show off Django, an MVC web framework using python.

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
