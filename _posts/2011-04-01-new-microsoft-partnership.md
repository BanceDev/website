<p>Amidst our past rivalry, and a fellow technology group that has been all but extinct, we in the Ohio State University Open Source Club have hereby formed a new partnership with the now re-established <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/ntsig">ntSig</a> (website coming soon). ntSig, or New Technology Special Interest Group, is a group sponsored by Microsoft for people who share an interest in software, computers and technology in general. This carefully considered decision was not made lightly, but we wish to honor some of our former members who now reside in Redmond, WA and set our political differences aside.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, out of respect for many of our former members, we in the Open Source Club administration have decided to partner with Microsoft. Despite our general hostility, and Microsoft's apparent attitude toward our philosophy, Microsoft has always been friendly to the club. We in the Open Source Club have at times been <a href="/vista">hostile</a> towards the Microsoft club and their events, but have now come to realize what Visual Studio has to offer the community. As part of our partnership, all members are now encouraged to sign in with their Windows Live ID, using the link on the left. Additionally, our website search has been replaced with <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> Search. In return for this sponsorship, Microsoft will provide all Linux users willing to format their drives with a free copy of Windows 7 Home Basic (coming soon). Additionally, as part of our partnership, all registration information may be shared with Microsoft or its affiliates unless you <a href="/ntsig">opt out</a>.</p>

<h3>APRIL FOOLS!!!</h3>
<p>We currently have no intention of partnering with Microsoft, and as far as we know the ntSig club remains inactive. This has been a well-meaning hoax by your webmaster. Furthermore, we will never share your information with anyone under any circumstances, per our <a href="/rules">terms of use</a>.</p>
<p>If you liked this April Fools' Day joke, you can check out an example of another related website hoax <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>.</p>
