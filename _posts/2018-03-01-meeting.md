    notes: |
      - Vulkan is an open, cross-platform GPU API from the Khronos Group, the industry body that also deveops OpenGL.
      - It is available on Windows, Linux, Android, Nintendo Switch, cloud systems already.
      - MoltenVK is a runtime for macOS and iOS that offers an almost complete subset of the Vulkan API.
      - The portable subset will also soon be able to target another platform: DirectX 12. Expected within the next few months, a similar translation layer is being developed that will enable Vulkan applications to use a DirectX 12 back-end.
