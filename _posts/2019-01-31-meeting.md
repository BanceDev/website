      > there’s been a battle going on behind the scenes over who is allowed to use the [streaming] technology needed to bring video to the people. For the past several years companies and creators have had to pay millions of dollars in licensing fees to use the technology that helps deliver videos to consumers.

      > The [Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia)](https://aomedia.org/), has developed and standardized a next-generation royalty-free video compression technology called AV1.

      Members of AOMedia:
      - Amazon
      - Apple
      - ARM
      - Cisco
      - Facebook
      - Google
      - IBM
      - Intel
      - Microsoft
      - Netflix
      - NVIDIA

      > AOM and AV1 were able to get to this point because this initiative isn’t just about software makers. We’ve also had hardware manufacturers on board...

      > The AV1 format is already 30% percent better than competing formats such as HEVC and VP9, and we’re not done yet.

      Shoutout to Librewulf who kept all of his music in either FLAC or another free & libre format out of respect.

      > Mintable allows you to automatically populate transactional data from your financial institutions into a Google Sheet for analysis and visualization.

      1. You create a "template" Google Sheet containing all the formulas and calculations you want to view on top of your transactions.
      2. You use Mintable (which uses the Plaid and Google Sheets APIs) to connect your financial institutions to that sheet and populate transactions as they update.
      3. Each month, Mintable will use the current month's sheet as the "base" for the next month, keeping all the formatting and calculations on top of your data intact.

      Subjects in a Stanford study were paid $100 on average to quit Facebook for a month.

      ## Pros

      - Improved subjective wellbeing
      - Increased the amount of time spent doing offline social activities
      - Led to a significant reduction of Facebook use after the study (abstinence) was over

      ## Cons

      - More time watching TV alone
      - Less informed about political views

      > We find little evidence to support the hypothesis suggested by prior work that Facebook might be more beneficial for 'active' users -- for example, users who regularly comment on pictures and posts from friends and family instead of just scrolling through their news feeds.

      > [...] other innovations, from novels to television to nuclear energy, have had a similar trajectory of overblown optimism about their potential to a backlash of alarm about their harm. In each case, these innovations are still with us, but the ways we use them and think about them have changed drastically over the years, in large part due to empirical research like this study.
