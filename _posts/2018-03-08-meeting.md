      ## Did someone say "Planned Obsolecense"?

      Intel's 8th generation Core "Coffee Lake" processors and their companion 300-series chipsets lacks compatibility with older 200-series and 100-series chipset motherboards, despite sharing an identical LGA1151 socket.

      Turns out that "Coffee Lake" processors are pin-compatible with older LGA1151 motherboards based on 200-series and 100-series chipsets after all, as modders got some of these chips to work on the older platforms.

      ## Software coders did this

      Intel is using software to prevent Coffee Lake from working on older motherboards.

      This software comes in the form of the CPU's microcode, the iGPU's UEFI GOP driver, and certain Management Engine bootstraps on the side of the motherboard BIOS that lets it recognize the new chips.

      ### Bonus: The modders also found ways to iron out several stability and compatibility issues.

      > Generally speaking, private keys for TLS certificates should never be archived by resellers, and, even in the rare cases where such storage is permissible, they should be tightly safeguarded.

      ## When it rains...

      Several hours later, Trustico's website went offline after a Web security expert posted a critical vulnerability on Twitter

      > [...] attackers could call code of their choice and get it to run on Trustico servers with unfettered "root" privileges.
