We have two mailing lists: A discussion mailing list and an announcements-only mailing list.  Announcements are sent to both so you will most likely want to subscribe only to one or the other.  If you are in the department of CS&amp;E at OSU you can also participate on the discussion list via the <strong>cse.opensource</strong> newsgroup.
