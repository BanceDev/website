We have two mailing lists: A discussion mailing list and an announcements-only mailing list. Announcements are sent to both so you will most likely want to subscribe only to one or the other. If you are in the department of CS&E at OSU you can also participate on the discussion list via the **cse.opensource** newsgroup.
