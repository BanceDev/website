      German researchers found images and links to images in bitcoin's blockchain.

      - 274 links to child abuse content
      - 142 links to dark web services

        - The company that employs Torvalds

      [This is the same guy who announced the "Year of the Linux Desktop" on a MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f8FPnAsIJ4)
