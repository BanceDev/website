The meeting on June 2 was our last official meeting of the quarter and academic year.  That said, the club does not completely die over the summer.

Some members have proposed having informal meetings, during the usual time (Thursdays at 7PM).  You can stay up to date with these by keeping up with the <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource">discussion mailing list</a> and our <a href="/irc">IRC Channel</a>.  Meeting details will be posted both here and on the <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce">announcement list</a> if something specific is planned.

In addition, there may be unfinished <a href="/projects">club projects</a>, and some members have <a href="/git">personal projects</a> for which they may appreciate help.

As always, for any other kinds of communication, you may use the <a href="https://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/contact">contact form</a>, <a href="/mailinglist">mailing list</a>, or <a href="/irc">IRC channel</a>.
