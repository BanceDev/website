      notes: |
        - Equifax says a vulnerability known publicly since early March allowed hackers to begin stealing personal information on as many as 143 million Americans two months later.
        - Patches published months before the massive hack began apparently weren't applied before the hack.
        - Equifax said it identified Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638, a flaw that was first identified on March 6, as the hack's gateway. The company located the problem with the help of an unidentified cybersecurity firm. Patches for the vulnerability were made available less than a week later.
