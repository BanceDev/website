      # What the Press Release Said

      > By joining the [Open Invention Network (OIN)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-open-sources-its-entire-patent-portfolio/), Microsoft is offering its entire patent portfolio to the open-source patent consortium's members.

      > Open source changed everything. Customers have changed. Fifteen years ago, a CIO would have said, 'we have no open source, they would have been wrong, but that's what they thought.' Now, CIOs know open source's essential[...] Microsoft has always been a company by, of, and for developers. At this point in history, developers love open source

      > What's happening now is that legal development and collaboration are catching up with technical development and collaboration. They're now happening in parallel.

      # What it means

      The Open Invention Network (OIN) is a patent non-aggression community that supports freedom of action in Linux as a key element of open source software. OIN acquires patents and licenses them **royalty-free** _to its community members_ who, in turn, agree not to assert their own patents against Linux and Linux-related systems and applications. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Invention_Network), emphasis mine)

      # Questions

      1. Does this mean that the patents were open sourced? (e.g. [Patentleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentleft))
        > If you're not an OIN member, you're not covered by its patent-protection pool.
      2. Does this mean that the technology is open source? (following the four freedoms)?
        > That's not to say you can run out and build an exFAT-based file system for your USB-drive tomorrow with no consequences. Only OIN members have a non-aggression pact with Microsoft. If you're not a member of the OIN, you still must license exFAT from Microsoft.
      3. Is this applicable to _all_ of Microsoft's patents?
        > If your program isn't open-source or falls outside the Linux System definition, you're not covered.
      4. Is M$ going to make Winbloze open source?
