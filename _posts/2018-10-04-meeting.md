  - title: "RISC-V 3D GPU"
    link: 'http://libre-riscv.org/3d_gpu/'
    notes: |
      > most of the energy of a GPU is spent getting data each way past the L2/L1 cache barrier

      > the idea is to make it entirely libre-licensed and royalty-free

      This is coming out of the [FOSSDEM 2018](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/) conference.

      ## What is POWER9

      POWER9 is an alternative to x86 processor architecture. Tom's Hardware has a nice [overview](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-power9-servers-supercomputers-nvidia,31567.html). It has support in the Linux kernel, and the support of [several distributions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/linuxonibm/liaam/liaamdistros.htm#liaamdistros__table_i11_l3f_1cc).

      > Blackbird is a micro-ATX motherboard intended for OpenPOWER desktops/appliances and other low-power computing needs.

      Raptor has several other POWER9 systems, and teased this release [earlier to Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Raptor-Prepping-New-POWER).

    notes: |
      > DesignStart is geared toward rapidly thrusting Arm's lower-end CPU blueprints into the hands of system-on-chip designers who are on a budget or are particularly enamored with FPGAs.
      >
      > there are no royalty nor license fees involved – the designs are available to download and use completely **gratis** for Xilinx components.

      > Previous DesignStart FPGA files were aimed at helping engineers prototype on gate arrays before they design and fabricate custom system-on-chips – whereas these latest blueprints streamline the development of FPGA-powered hardware, all the way from research stages to volume production and deployment.

      > The latest hotness (for ARM) right now is hardware accelerators, which are typically repurposed graphics cards, or customized chips, that applications on a host device can offload specialist work onto. These accelerators require controller CPU cores to glue their subsystems together, and thus a drop-in Cortex-M core could be just the ticket.

      > Nested on the servers’ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design.

      And it was just as bad as you might expect.

      > they incorporated memory, networking capability, and sufficient processing power for an attack.

      How could FOSS hardware help?

      > Mindful of the Elemental findings, Amazon’s security team conducted its own investigation into AWS’s Beijing facilities and found altered motherboards there as well, including more sophisticated designs than they’d previously encountered.
