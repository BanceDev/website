# Officers

**President** - Dominik Winecki

**We will be choosing new officers for the 2021-2022 year**


# Website

Would we really be an open source org if we didn't list our underlying tech?

Our [website](https://github.com/osuosc/website) is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [Kube](https://github.com/jeblister/kube) theme.

We also use Font Awesome for icons.
