This week we'll have Ben Keith come in to give a talk!

Ben Keith will talk about WordPress, the open-source content management system. He'll discuss and demonstrate some of the CMS's many features, the WordPress command-line utility, and the workflows of theme and plugin development.

Ben works at the [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org/) on [the Labs team](https://labs.inn.org/) as lead developer, building WordPress plugins and themes. He graduated from the Ohio State University's College of Food, Agriculture, and Environmental Sciences in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, majoring in agricultural communication and minoring in plant pathology.

Fun fact: [The Lantern's website](http://thelantern.com/) is built with WordPress.
