Contracts are an important part of business and they come in many shapes and sizes. As many people may be interested in taking up freelance work now or in the future, this week I will be covering the types of contracts that exist, the contract life cycle, and contracts in the software development world. I will also be covering some of the open source licenses that are out there and I will touch briefly on what licenses you should use in your projects!
