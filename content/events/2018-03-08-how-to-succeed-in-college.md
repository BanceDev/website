How many times have you sat in a lecture and wondered to yourself "When will I ever use this?" In some cases, you are fully justified in doubting your studies. However, in many other cases what you are learning will be useful in ways you might not expect (*cough*technical interviews*cough*). In my talk, I aim to help you sort the diamonds from the rough and suggest which textbooks you can burn and which you may want to keep around. Lastly, I'll provide some suggestions for how you may want to spend your time out of the classroom in order to truly take advantage of college life. 

#### As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
