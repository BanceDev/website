This week at the Open Source Club we will be having a developer and some recruiters in from CoverMyMeds in to talk about a day in the life of a developer at CoverMyMeds and some of the open source web tools they use in their development cycle. They will be coming in with their recruiters and this would be a great opportunity to talk with them about their Co-Op Program they offer to students.

#### As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
