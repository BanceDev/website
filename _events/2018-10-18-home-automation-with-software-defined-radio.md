Ever thought about designing your own smart home?  In this talk, we'll focus on practical applications of replay attacks on off-the-shelf home automation devices, allowing them to be controlled with a Raspberry Pi.  On the way, we'll delve into how these devices transmit data over the air and how we can intercept and replay these transmissions using only a $20 RTL-SDR dongle, a Raspberry Pi, and free and open source software packages.  We'll also discuss how we can tie these replay attacks into popular home automation suites, such as Home Assistant.

#### As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
