This week, Daniel `paradigm` Thau will be presenting [`ledger-cli`](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) [1], a command line double-entry accounting system.  Ledger-cli's file format is both human and machine readable, suitable for manipulation with UNIX utilities and tracking in version control.  Ledger-cli is useful not only for traditional currencies and stocks, but also cryptocurrencies and abstract "commodities" such as PTO days.  No accounting background will be necessary to follow the presentation.

#### As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
