Commands that work together form the basis of \*nix systems. You can take advantage of existing tools by making your own work well with others.


In this Talk we'll discuss:
  - What makes a command line application "well-behaved"
  - Why you might want to use Python (and when you might not)
  - How you can use the `click` package to make your own CLIs


Demos and a tutorial are available for those that want to try it for themselves.


As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
