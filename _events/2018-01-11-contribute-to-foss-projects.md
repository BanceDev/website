This week, we'll be talking about how to get started contributing to FOSS projects. This should cover any skill level, so even if you've never made a "Hello World" you should come away having learned how to help out with your favorite projects. It will be this Thursday, 7:30 p.m. at CL 120.

As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
