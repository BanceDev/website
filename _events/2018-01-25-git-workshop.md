This week, we'll be walking through one of the most common ways of contributing to an Open Source project, by using git and github. This will be a complete walkthrough of how to work collaboratively in the open source community.

Also, as promised, today elections will be held for the officer positions as [listed on the website](https://opensource.osu.edu/info/officers/). As usual, the requirements for voting are as follows:

- Member on the opensource club mailing list
- Attend at least one meeting during the semester
- Full time student for 2018-2019 school year

As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
