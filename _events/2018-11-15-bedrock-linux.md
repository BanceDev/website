Daniel `paradigm` Thau will present Bedrock Linux, a Linux distribution composed of software from other, typically mutually exclusive distributions.

If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentooâ€™s portage, and ensure that software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux provides a means to achieve this. The presentation will cover the motivation behind the Bedrock Linux, various real-world use cases for the project, and live demos.  

#### As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided.
