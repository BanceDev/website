If you have ever been lost when trying to compile or make menuconfig just confused you so much that you wanted to pull your hair out, then this meeting is for you. A few of our members will be making a collaborative effort on this topic so bring your questions to us and we will do our best to help. We will be going over how to compile a kernel the Debian way, the Gentoo way, and we also will be giving a general overview of the process as a whole so that it can be better understood. Bring your questions and concerns, we will be happy to address them.</p>

Michael will be demonstrating the basics of building a Python program, beginning with a Hello World in the interpreter and moving over to building Hello World as a stand-a-lone file. Then, he’ll cover functions, documentation, and linking files together. Then, Brian will be demonstrating how to use Python to solve problems for class, work, and research as well as teaching the basic use of some powerful scientific and mathematical tools collected in the SciPy module.</p>

FreeGeek Columbus provides computers and training for limited-resource populations in Central Ohio through redistribution of used equipment and the use of Free Software. FreeGeek Columbus is committed to Free Software, responsible electronics recycling, and community engagement. In his presentation, Scott gave us a brief overview of who FreeGeek is and what they do, touch upon the hazards of electronic waste, describe how FreeGeek rewards volunteers, and share how they’re advocating Ubuntu Linux to people. After his presentation Scott answered everyone’s questions! As always, there will be pizza! <strong>Update:</strong>At the end of this meeting, we voted on finalizing some constitutional amendments from <a href="/node/88">last year</a>. Find changes attached.</p>

      <p>This Thursday at 7pm in Dreese Labs 266, Alex Lingo, a former President and Vice President of the club, will be presenting on the much misunderstood topic of LVM. The Logical Volume Manager is a system in the Linux kernel that allows the abstraction of physical data volumes into so called “logical volumes”. For example, with LVM, 3 1TB disks can be combined into a single 3TB linear volume. Alex is going to give a brief overview of how the system works, as well as give a demonstration first hand to show the ins and outs of the system. I hope to see you all there!</p>

We will go over all the pros, cons, features, strengths, setup nuances, requirements, and finally how to pick the perfect distro for your needs. After the overview we will then run through a graphical install of Ubuntu and then a text based install of Debian in order to both show the differences between the distributions and how text and graphical installs differ. Our meeting will be on Thursday October 1st in Dreese Labs room 266 and, as always, the meeting is open to everyone. We especially welcome newcomers to this meeting so we can introduce you to the world of Linux and how to get started! Bring any questions you have and we will be happy to answer.

Please note: We are located in Dreese Labs room <strong>266</strong>. This is not in the main part of Dreese, and easily confused with <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=280">Baker Systems and Engineering</a>. The room is near the bridge connecting Dreese and Baker, and to the west. To get there, either enter through Dreese, cross the bridge, and turn right; or enter through Baker and turn left down the long hallway before the bridge.</p>

<p>Jamie recently collaborated with Mike Gordan, a member of the band Phish, to create an interactive multimedia installation which was part of the 2009 Boston Cyberarts Festival. For this project, he designed, built, and programmed a wireless, distributed, people-sensing system capable of playing sounds and controlling lights based on proximity to works of art. He will present an overview of this system as well as describe some other recent product designs for the music and pro audio industry.</p>

<p>The meeting will be at 7:30pm in Knowlton 250. Everyone is invited to come and there will be free pizza and pop.</p>

<p>Jamie holds a degree in Engineering Physics, was a director of Research &amp; Development for Walt Disney Imagineering for over 10 years, and has been involved in the design of numerous milestone music products such as the Linn9000 drum machine and the Synclavier digital music system. He currently lives in Boston, where he serves as a design consultant for embedded systems, and last year released two CDs of guitar music which he engineered and mixed himself.</p>

      <p>This Thursday [3/5/09], brought to you by Alek Rollyson, we talked about certain important internet related topics. How does one go to work without leaving his house? How does one completely mask himself to the internet? How does one hide his traffic from <em>even his own ISP</em>? All of these are accomplished by what we discussed. Specifically we talked about (and covered to some extent):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet privacy, the cute little paradox</li>
  <li>SSH Tunneling
    <ul>
      <li>How (and why) to use DD-WRT for a nice little SSH tunnel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proxies: TOR, SOCKS, etc.</li>
  <li>VPN</li>
</ul>
