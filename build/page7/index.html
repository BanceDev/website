    <span class="date">posted: 01-24-2013</span>

    
      <p>This Thursday at 7 pm, in Dreese Lab 369, Brian Swaney will teach us GIMP image editing techniques. The presentation will be interactive and encourage audience participation, so you should bring a laptop with GIMP already installed to follow along. Some techniques covered may include <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. Some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may be covered if time allows, just to show that GIMP can live up to the same standard as <em>other editors whose names are withheld due to trademark licensing concerns</em>, but no prior experience is required.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>The presentation will use 2.8. If you haven’t installed GIMP yet, make sure you install 2.8, and if you have 2.6 installed, you should upgrade to 2.8 if feasible. Differences between the 2 versions will still be covered where applicable.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, 2013/01/24 at 7:00pm (EST, -5G MT) in Dreese Labs 369, Michael Yanovich will take you upon a journey of exploring the depths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">irc</a>. He will be covering: what IRC is, what IRC is used for, and most importantly how to interface with IRC. From general observations, it appears that many in the club use IRC and many more would like to participate in the IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/osuosc">#osuosc</a> on <a href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this talk is to provide information on using IRC in a terminal that is remotely connected a dedicated machine running a GNU/Linux variant in a way that facilitates easy access and <a href="https://xkcd.com/705/">optimal uptime</a>. While there exist countless IRC clients for countless platforms this talk is going to focus on using IRC from a GNU/Linux machine that is left on 24/7, “dedicated”, so that one can SSH into the machine (from Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux) and pull up their session the way they left it. This is often called “idling” and most people on the larger IRC networks often “idle”. The software combination that will be described in detail for this talk is WeeChat and tmux. If you would like to follow along, please bring a laptop running a GNU/Linux variant and have a working Internet connection. There will be no slides and this will be a live demonstration of how to set up WeeChat and tmux on the GNU/Linux distribution Debian 6 “Squeeze”.</p>

<p><strong>Preparations:</strong> You can install tmux through most package managers on most GNU/Linux <a href="http://bedrocklinux.org/">distributions</a>. WeeChat should be downloaded and compiled from source to obtain the latest version, <a href="http://weechat.org/download/stable/">0.4.0</a> (which was released this past Sunday, 2013/01/20). The compilation of WeeChat will briefly be demonstrated.</p>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> The OSUOSC offers access to a system designed specifically for “idling”. You must be a student to request access and access can only be given in person. Please contact an officer of the club today for more information!</p>

<p><strong>Afterwards:</strong> There will be a PGP signing party after the IRC meeting. If you would like to participate please bring a piece of paper with necessary information to sign your key (full name, e-mail address associated with your key, key ID and/or your key fingerprint, and where to obtain your public key), as we will only be exchanging papers for the signing party. Also, please bring at least one government issued photo identification with you if you would like others to sign your PGP key, individual members may have more strict requirements for signing your PGP key. If you have any questions please feel free to <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/contact">contact us</a>. Additionally, we will go over how to create a PGP key during this segment.</p>

This talk is not intended to fully educate the audience on the use of the discussed functionality so much as make the audience aware of the advanced functionality Vim has to offer in order to have something to work towards.  Comfort with the basics of Vim would be useful but not required.</p>

<p>Some of the items planned on being discussed are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>text-objects</li>
  <li>marks</li>
  <li>registers</li>
  <li>macros</li>
  <li>folding</li>
  <li>syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>mappings</li>
  <li>buffers/windows/tabs</li>
  <li>accessing remote files (scp://, ftp://, etc)</li>
  <li>running shell commands from within Vim</li>
  <li>the nuances of visual mode</li>
  <li>several cmdline commands such as :s and :g</li>
  <li>autocmds</li>
  <li>cmdline-window</li>
  <li>tags</li>
  <li>plugins</li>
  <li>diffs</li>
  <li>quickfix</li>
  <li>ins-completion</li>
  <li>basic vimscript</li>
  <li>automatic indentation</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is anything else you would like, do not hesitate to ask about it.</p>

      <p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>This Thursday, 2012/10/18 at 7pm in Dreese Labs 266, The Ohio State Open Source Club will be presenting “What NOT to do with your F/OSS Operating System.”</p>

<p>This talk will be done a little more casual, with members sharing disaster stories of what they have done to their operating systems.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to participate, I just ask that you email me back with these three fields so that I may make you a slide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating System</li>
  <li>What broke</li>
  <li>Solution if there was one</li>
</ul>

<p>also please have around 5 minutes of material to your story, if possible. As always, there will be pizza.</p>

      <p>Thursday, October 11th at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau will be presenting an introduction to the Vim text editor.  Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as, but not limited to, programming), the benefits can far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>In the past, Daniel’s presentations on Vim have attempted to provide benefit, for everyone from those completely new to Vim to more experienced users.  Instead, two talks on Vim will be given this time around: one for those who are new to Vim and another intended to benefit those already comfortable with Vim.  This first talk on October 11th will be solely an introduction; it will focus on the basics and be at a relatively slow pace.</p>

<p>Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux, as well as other platforms. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install Vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>
