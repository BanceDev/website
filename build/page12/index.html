      <p>This Thursday, at 7 pm in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Matt Smith will be demonstrating an Open Music Server that he has been working on. It might seem too easy and obvious to bother with in this day and age. We all know how to rip CD’s, collect and share music, and move it to our portables for on-the-go music. My server comes from an audiophile standpoint. Long story short, I used to sell expensive stereo equipment. There are people out there right now spending up to $60,000 on CD players. I’d like to show you how to build your own that competes with these on sound quality, is easier to use, much more fun, has more features, and is completely free. edit: my blog: http://opensourceaudiophile.com/</p>

      <p>Thursday, September 23 is the first meeting of autumn quarter. We will be meeting in the Ohio Union Senate Room (note the change in location from last year) at 7PM. After a short introduction of the club and a brief description of the blood drive we are sponsoring on the 30th, Matt Meinwald will present an overview of Free operating systems, focusing primarily on GNU/Linux distributions. The main software component of a computer is its operating system, and it is good to know we have plenty of Free and Open Source options for this important role. Matt will discuss and demo popular desktop GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, and OpenSuse, then if time remains, will open discussion to anyone who wishes to talk about his/her favorite distribution. As it turned out, most everyone already knew about these topics, so we discussed what the club does and future meeitngs instead of the original topic. <a href="/~paradigm/minutes.html#htoc7">Minutes</a> for this meeting</p>

<p>This meeting will mostly be aimed at preparing for autumn quarter, including scheduling as many of those meetings as possible, and deciding on our fall event. If time permits, it will also include a technical overview of our computer systems for future admins. This meeting is optional, but strongly encouraged for officers, and somewhat encouraged for people interested in presenting next quarter. If you want to give a presentation but cannot attend the meeting, just send an email to meetings@opensource.osu.edu with your meeting topic and availability to present, and we’ll put just as much effort into fitting you into the schedule as if you were able to attend. If you are available during the meeting time, but cannot be there in person, you can join us remotely by IRC (#osu_osc on freenode, check http://opensource.osu.edu/irc for details).</p>

      <p>On Saturday, May 22 in the Ohio Union, the Ohio State Open Source Club will be hosting a LAN Party from 10 AM Saturday morning until 3 AM Sunday morning. Per our Free and open source philosophy, we will be promoting games that either run natively in Linux or run well in WINE and, while some of the games themselves might not be free or open source in nature, we would like to show how gaming in Linux is not a lost cause. We will be providing a venue for people to come out and play the following computer games:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quake 3</li>
  <li>Quake Live</li>
  <li>Starcraft and Starcraft: Brood War</li>
  <li>Any game that runs natively in Linux (one of us will surely play and we are always looking for good F/OSS games)</li>
  <li>If you’re not sure whether a game runs in WINE or natively on Linux, bring it out and we will investigate together!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We will be providing pizza around lunch and dinner times as well as limited amounts of soft drinks (Coke products of course).</strong> This is an open event so anyone and everyone are welcome, including users of all operating systems of course (these games run just fine in Windows), we are just trying to show how Linux users are not stuck when it comes to gaming. Even if you have never played any of these games, but just like gaming, come on out and we will show you the ropes! We will be posting more information about the LAN party as time draws closer and you will be able to find and receive up-to-date information in the following two ways: The LAN Party wiki: http://opensource.osu.edu/lan And/Or you can join our announcement list to get information as it is released: http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce The LAN Party is tentatively being held in the Ohio Union Creative Arts room but this is subject to change, you will be able to get up-to-date information through the channels listed above. The games list is also subject to change as we get suggestions or come up with more ideas. If you have any questions you can send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu. So, join the mailing list or check the wiki for info as it is posted and we hope to see you all there…happy gaming!</p>

      <p>This <strong>Thursday, May 6th at 7PM in <em>Caldwell 133</em> (note the change),</strong> Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

      <p>This <strong>Thursday, May 20th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> we will be discussing open source gaming, gaming on Linux, gaming with <a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/">WINE</a>, and just general options for gaming once you switch to an open source operating system. One complaint that seems common in the open source OS world is that gaming is pretty much thrown out the window once you have made the switch. We would like to spend the meeting debunking this myth and showing all of the options that one has in the open source gaming arena. We will be showing pure open source games, games that you probably didn’t know ran natively in Linux, and how gaming in <a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/">WINE</a> has improved by leaps and bounds recently and actually does a relatively good job with some of our beloved games that only work on Windows. So come on out and join the discussion and hopefully learn how you are not totally hopeless gaming wise when switching to an open source operating system!</p>

<p>This Meeting is in preparation for our LAN party that we are hosting Saturday, May 22nd! There will be more information provided at the meeting and you can join our <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce">announcement mailing list</a> for up to date information, or check the <a href="/lan">wiki</a>!</p>

      <p>This <strong>Thursday, April 29th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 317,</strong> we will be spending the meeting time attempting to install Linux on anything. We have members with PS3’s, iPods, XBOX’s, Wii’s, phones and whatever else you can think of and we are going to attempt to install an operating system of our choice on them. These members are volunteering their hardware for the meeting and recognize that performing these actions may violate warranties and are not responsible for attempts made meeting goers’ own electronics. We are only showing these demonstrations as proof of concept that it is possible to put your own software on hardware that, when it boils down to it, is essentially just a computer built for a specific purpose. So, if you are interested in talking about trying to put Linux on anything and everything, come on out and join in on the fun. Hope to see you there!</p>

MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux).

      <p>This <strong>Thursday, April 15th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> we will be hosting a discussion session revolving around tips, tricks, and time savers that people have discovered. Do you think you have an awesome .bashrc, .vimrc, key binding, or a little known useful program and want to show it off? This would be the perfect opportunity to share with the rest of the club. There are lots of nifty things that are not widely known and we think this would be a good opportunity to share your knowledge of time savers with others! We will not be using the typical presentation format in lieu of a more informal discussion atmosphere, so feel free to come on out and share your tips as well as learn some new ones at the same time. Hope to see you there!</p>

      <p>This <strong>Thursday, April 8th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> we will be holding a lightning talk session focusing on programming languages. It came to our attention that knowledge of different languages was fragmented amongst meeting goers so we decided that we should each take turns introducing each other to languages that we have learned and think others would appreciate or find useful. The lightning talk format consists of short talks that each focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. Thus far we have had volunteers for the following languages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>Bash</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Lisp</li>
  <li>Perl</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be attaching demos and slides from the talks as they are available, so check back.</p>
