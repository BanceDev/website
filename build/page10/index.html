      <p>October 13th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Vim, an extremely powerful text editing program. Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost. Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it. Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others. Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim. Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

    <span class="date">posted: 09-27-2011</span>

    
      <p>This Thursday, in Dreese Lab room 266, I will demonstrating how you can make pictures lie using only open source software. Fanboys will often proclaim what they can do in a certain expensive proprietary image editor that shall not be named, so I’m going to demonstrate just the same things are do-able from another certain free, open source program. My claim is that <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is <em>just</em> as capable of making your pictures lie as any other mainstream image manipulation software.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. I also do not know the level of audience to expect, I don’t script or rehearse my presentations, and simply impressing you isn’t going to teach you anything. Therefore, the presentation shall be interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

<p>Whether you’re trying to create a <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">desktop</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wijtKqdUYsM">background</a>, <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-july-14-2008/photoshop-of-horrors">troll people</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIVJQG2XREA">remove braces</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">pass an art class</a>, <a href="http://ajitgraphics.blogspot.com/2008/09/neon-lights-tutorial-gimp.html">create</a> <a href="http://www.gimpusers.com/tutorials/hot-wallpaper-1.html">special</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY7LMnsf-7Y">effects</a>, <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/340907/july-07-2010/the-economist-photoshops-obama-s-picture">push a political agenda</a>, <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">tell a story</a> or just generally make girls feel bad about themselves to promote your brand, Gimp is more than likely suited to fit your needs.

      <p>Thursday, September 29th at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 266, Michael Yanovich will be covering wireless security with a heavy regard towards wireless hacking. He will be covering how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to try to protect your network. He will be demonstrating these attacks as well, and he encourages people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate (if your wireless card can not run the available software, he will be providing a sample dump for you to play around with, this will be available at the meeting). Everyone is encouraged to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.  Michael is am bringing my own equipment for demonstrative purposes and he encourage everyone to participate in the presentation.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily accessible on the Internet.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, May 26 at 7PM, we will be meeting in <strong>Hitchcock 224</strong> where First Year Engineering staff will present on Arduino.</p>

<p>Come to a hands-on open hardware/open source Arduino microcontroller introduction given by the staff of First Year Engineering (FYE) program with an emphasis on their new lab centered about the “Advance Energy Vehicle (AEV),” controlled, of course, by an Arduino.  FYE will supply computer accounts and breadboards with installed Arduinos, so you can cruise through some simple hands-on examples of controlling motors, servos, acquiring analog data, reading and writing to digital pins, and effectively using interrupts (simpler than you would imagine) with this simple eight bit device.  A Matlab/Arduino interface created by Dr. Campa at Mathworks will be displayed, including a “real-time” data graphing example along with simple servo and motor control.  Some other Arduino related tools, such as the fritzing.org software, will also be displayed and discussed.  A pitch will be given for ideas, and possibly programming help, in simplifying the AEV code as much as possible for students with Matlab, but no C++, background.</p>

      <p>Club elections will be held May 12, 2011. If you are interested in running, please email elections@opensource.osu.edu in order to be listed here and in the meeting announcement. Any OSU student who has been to at least one meeting is eligible to run for president, vice president, or treasurer.</p>

<p>The following people have announced their candidacy.</p>

<p>President: Daniel Thau
Vice President: Paul Schwendenman, Brian Swaney (tentative)
Treasurer: Joel Friedly</p>

<p>In addition, Brian Swaney has proposed the following ballot initiative.</p>

<p>With most discussion surrounding ACTA/COCIA/SHIELD and Wikileaks ex post facto legislation died down, the immediate urgency with which it was hastily voted on and posted is alleviated. The senator who introduced the Espionage amendment (SHIELD Act, by John Ensign R-NV) which sparked this movement is also no longer in office, although a key co-sponsor Joe Lieberman I-CT is still in office. Therefore, during the election procedure I believe we should also vote on its removal. While the Open Source Club will continue its endorsement of EFF, it no longer seems necessary to keep extra clutter on our web page. <em>Shall the Ohio State University Open Source Club remove the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Say NO to online censorship” button?</em></p>

      <p>This Thursday, May 5th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau and Alek Rollyson will be presenting on Linux Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a several applications of MAC will be demonstrated, such as locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, April 14th at 7PM in Dreese 264, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on open source artificial intelligence for the board game Go.</p>

<p>Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for.  Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI’s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</p>

<p>Daniel will be discussing why humans are so much better than computers at Go despite the simple rule set and two general approaches taken by open source Go AI developers.</p>

<p>The talk is intended to be interesting to seasoned Go players and AI hobbyists as well as those who know nothing about about the game or AI development.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, April 7 at 7PM in Dreese 264, Alek Rollyson will be covering open source security tools from protocol analyzers to vulnerability scanners. This talk is meant as a general overview of tools available as well as their practical applications in security audits and penetration testing. Tools and topics covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wireshark (protocol analyzer)</li>
  <li>Metasploit (penetration testing suite)</li>
  <li>Ettercap (multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN)</li>
  <li>Aircrack-ng (set of tools for testing wireless security)</li>
  <li>OpenVAS (open source replacement for Nessus, a vulnerability scanner)</li>
  <li>Nmap (swiss army port scanner)</li>
  <li>Password Crackers (John the Ripper, Ophcrack)</li>
  <li>Distros such as Backtrack, Knoppix STD, Damn Vulnerable Linux</li>
  <li>Kippo (simple honeypot with recording capabilities)</li>
  <li>A few hardening techniques and tools (mandatory access control, port knocking, intrusion detection tools, common sense things, old wive’s tales)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This talk is meant for educational purposes only. Techniques demonstrated should only be used on your own systems as using any of these techniques on systems that you do not own has a high probability of you ending up behind bars. These tools will be presented from the perspective of a security auditor and/or a systems administrator wishing to find weak spots in his or her own defenses. Here’s the link to the slides: https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0Af5yg4EkTWfdZGhwcGRyYnZfNjRmdnB0bTQ2OA&amp;hl=en</p>

    <span class="date">posted: 04-01-2011</span>

    
      <p>Amidst our past rivalry, and a fellow technology group that has been all but extinct, we in the Ohio State University Open Source Club have hereby formed a new partnership with the now re-established <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/ntsig">ntSig</a> (website coming soon). ntSig, or New Technology Special Interest Group, is a group sponsored by Microsoft for people who share an interest in software, computers and technology in general. This carefully considered decision was not made lightly, but we wish to honor some of our former members who now reside in Redmond, WA and set our political differences aside.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, out of respect for many of our former members, we in the Open Source Club administration have decided to partner with Microsoft. Despite our general hostility, and Microsoft’s apparent attitude toward our philosophy, Microsoft has always been friendly to the club. We in the Open Source Club have at times been <a href="/vista">hostile</a> towards the Microsoft club and their events, but have now come to realize what Visual Studio has to offer the community. As part of our partnership, all members are now encouraged to sign in with their Windows Live ID, using the link on the left. Additionally, our website search has been replaced with <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> Search. In return for this sponsorship, Microsoft will provide all Linux users willing to format their drives with a free copy of Windows 7 Home Basic (coming soon). Additionally, as part of our partnership, all registration information may be shared with Microsoft or its affiliates unless you <a href="/ntsig">opt out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="april-fools">APRIL FOOLS!!!</h3>

<p>We currently have no intention of partnering with Microsoft, and as far as we know the ntSig club remains inactive. This has been a well-meaning hoax by your webmaster. Furthermore, we will never share your information with anyone under any circumstances, per our <a href="/rules">terms of use</a>.</p>

<p>If you liked this April Fools’ Day joke, you can check out an example of another related website hoax <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, March 31 at 7PM in Dreese 264 we will see presentations on window managers and desktop environments. Dan Thau will show the window managers dwm and Openbox as well as LXDE which uses the latter. Mike Yanovich will demonstrate the Awesome window manager and Gnome desktop environment (version 2.x). Alek Rollyson will present Window Manager From Scratch. Alex Lingo will talk about KDE. Mike Bettencourt will introduce Gnome 3. Matt Meinwald will explain the XFCE desktop environment and Compiz.</p>

<p>Note that the order will likely be different than the one above. Hopefully by the end of the meeting, everyone will know enough about window managers to choose the one(s) that suit them best.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, March 10 at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will be having lightning talks on the Open Source projects people are working on. If you have something you are working on, please comment below so I can get an idea of the time limits for these talks. If you don’t hear otherwise, assume they are five minutes each and a maximum of two talks per person. If anyone has a gong to help enforce these guidelines, please let me know. We need to do planning during this meeting as well, so please do your best to stay under time, and bring your meeting ideas.</p>
