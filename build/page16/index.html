      <p>We are meeting Thursday, April 10th, at 7:00 in Dreese Labs room 266. The topic
for our meeting is source code version control, and what works best for, and
there has already been much traffic over this on our <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/pipermail/opensource/2008-April/thread.html">mailing list</a>.
Subtopics so far include <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">bitkeeper</a>, <a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/">cvs</a>,

and open discussion of any other source code management programs not yet
mentioned that deserve recognition.</p>

      <p>We had our first meeting for the quarter in Dreese Labs room 266 at 7:00 pm.
Meetings end whenever they end, with no specific time. No absolute topic was
decided on, so we discussed a few random things, such as South Park creators
Trey Parker and Matt Stone streaming <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/south-park-to-o.html">South Park online</a>
for free (where we legally watched a recent episode from Season 12, which does
play in Linux without DRM hacks), Adobe creating a web-based free express
(and watered down) version of <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/">Photoshop</a>,
we also spent a few minutes sharing our web-development views. The meeting was
open to students and non-students alike, and pizza was served as always.
Altogether we had a great turnout and I look forward to a similar turnout at
our next meeting.</p>

      <p>Last week, we had a really good turnout and watched some demos of <a href="http://www.usmechatronics.com/usmgarage/WiiBot.html">hacking the Nintendo Wii remote</a>
to create your own virtual 3-D environment in relative to your perspective,
along with a few other slick <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/65">multi-touch-screen interfaces</a>,
bordering on making keyboards obsolete. We had a really great turnout and are
considering doing it in the future. More information is yet to come… There is
also some talk about hacking the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PCEEE" title="ASUS Eee PC - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Eee</a>,
a $500 child-sized laptop similar to the <a href="http://laptop.org/laptop/" title="One Laptop per Child">OX</a>
(One Laptop per Child campaign) with Linux pre-installed that, for the price,
has some pretty impressive hardware specs, and I might add it is very light-weight.</p>

      <p>We are meeting tonight (Thursday, February 28th) at <strong>6:00 pm</strong> in
<strong>Scott Lab room 103</strong>. Please note that this is not the normal time/location we
meet. We are meeting <strong>one hour before</strong> our normal meeting time, and in
<strong>Scott Lab</strong> instead of Dreese Lab. Our guest speaker, Jim Muir, is a nuclear
and mechanical engineering who had better write solid code, and this
presentation could be volatile, so we can just let Scott Labs bear this one. Jim
Muir is speaking to us about a new open source content management system called
SilverStripe. Pizza will be served and as always everyone is welcome.</p>

      <p>After months of returning error messages to users who went to
opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum, the <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum" title="Click here to enter our forums">Open Source Club forums</a>
are back online. This past summer, p0rn and pharmaceutical spammers had a
field day, then our website got taken offline and we had to disable forums and
comments. We have cleaned up some lingering spam comments, re-enabled the forum,
and added a captcha requirement in order for anyone to log in, as well as a few
other random things. Spamming in the forums will absolutely not be tolerated. If
you find any spam on this site, please report it <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum/21">here</a>
and a moderator will delete it and block/delete the offending user’s account.</p>

<p>For the time being, only <em>.edu e-mail addresses may register</em> but if you have a
current account with another address that you already registered then it should
still be active. If you do not have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.edu</code> address and would like access to
the forum, you can <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/contact" title="Contact us">contact me</a>
or another administrator telling us your e-mail address before you try to create
the account so we can authorize it. <em>Please</em> only do this if you do not have a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.edu</code> address. Otherwise, we ask that you use your school address for
registering. We use this to keep track of users (e.g. someone with a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">name.#@osu.edu</code> is less likely to be a spammer than <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin@viagra.com</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cmbb@dbx.hk</code>) and to restrict spammers from creating accounts just to hose

      <p>Our last meeting (Nov 15) was about the Open Handset Alliance’s Android. A
mobile operation system and application stack. We had a demo with the Hello
World and spent a lot of the time playing with the emulator prototype. Because
I feel this is a very interesting development, I personally will be working on
creating some apps for the platform. In addition, Google has $10M in prizes for
developers who create interesting new applications for this platform.</p>

      <p>The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University (OSSOSU) will be holding
officer elections to represent us for the next (07-08) school year. The
eligibility requirements for being an officer are that you are a student at
Ohio State, and that you are a member of the club (have attended at least one
meeting). Graduate and undergraduates are both equals in this matter.</p>

<p>Open Positions: Benevolent Dictator, Number Two, and Treasurer</p>

<p>Office Holders for school year 2006-2007 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Benevolent Dictator: Alex Lingo</li>
  <li>Number Two: Tom Hess</li>
  <li>Treasurer: Peter Dietz</li>
</ul>

<p>Benevolent Dictator will be known as President to the university must attend
training meetings, as well as the treasurer. Number Two just has to look pretty.</p>

<p>P.S. I rearranged the office.</p>

<p><br /></p>

      <p>…atleast our mailing list has caught fire.</p>

<p>Who would have thought “Linux vs. Windows” would have drawn any attention? I just want to rehash a comment made during our latest meeting “This week in slashdot” where +5 points was awarded for mentioning that “the Internet is not a drug”…</p>

<p>I believe there was a joke in there, something about doing something for coke…</p>

      <p>A dual perspective approach to the Net Neutrality debate. Think of it as driving on the highway and you can go 60mph for a regular rate, or 80mph at a more expensive rate. Everyone is in favor of being able to pay more to go faster, but net neutrality adds that the guy at 60 should be able to go everywhere that the guy at 80 can go without additional charges.</p>

<p>That might or might not be accurate, but it has scary things in it like the Patriot Act, but nobody has actually read either one.</p>

<p>Conclusion: unresolved</p>

<p>Paul gave a great presentation on PulseAudio, the new sound server that will
officially make its debut in GNOME <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.18</code>. As a special treat, Alex gave a preview
of Peter’s upcoming Net Neutrality meeting, explaining that the Internet is not
a dump truck, but really a series of tubes.</p>

      <p>Hello all, I hope everyone had a great summer and is ready for the next quarter of the Opensource Club to begin! We have a couple of important events occurring within the first few weeks of the quarter I’d like to talk a bit about, since they are new and exciting.</p>

<p>The Opensource Club will be taking part in the Student Involvement Fair on September 18th. We will have a table in the Technology section of the fair. The Student Involvement Fair will be held from 12:00 noon to 4:00pm on the Oval and will include dozens of student organizations and thousands of attendees. This is a great chance to advertise ourselves to the incoming freshmen class and to all students of Ohio State.</p>

<p>Then on September 30th is Ohio LinuxFest 2006! LinuxFest will be held at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in downtown Columbus. We are also proudly taking part in this event, with a table of our own. There will speakers, vendor and community exhibits, and plenty of swag. Information can be found on the Ohio LinuxFest website, and more will be added to the site soon. This is a chance to show the greater community our spirit and resolve to be a great community player.</p>

<p>Both events are completely free to attend, but it should be noted that Ohio LinuxFest requires all attendees to register by September 22. LinuxFest is offering an All Conference Pass for $65.00, which is completely optional, and includes several perks, all detailed on the attendance page. We will be organizing a group of attendees once the date draws closer. I will send out more detailed e-mails about each event as they draw nearer.</p>

<p>Now, we are currently in the planning stages, but one thing we would like to give away at both events is a flier detailing ourselves and listing at least our first five or six meetings of the quarter. For this, we need speakers. I’d like to ask for five speakers to offer to give presentations for the first few meetings of the quarter. We want to show anyone interested in our organization that we are alive, kicking, and in full-swing for the up-and-coming year. This year we will be continuing in the alternating Tuesday/Thursday at 7:00pm format that we used last year, since it seemed to work well for most people. If it turns out to not be the best way to continue, we can discuss alternate ideas.</p>

<p>Barring any problems, here is my tentative schedule of meeting dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday 9/18: Student Involvement Fair</li>
  <li>Thursday 9/21: Welcome Back with Alex!</li>
  <li>Tuesday 9/26: Speaker needed</li>
  <li>Saturday 9/30: Ohio LinuxFest 2006</li>
  <li>Thursday 10/5: Speaker needed</li>
  <li>Tuesday 10/10: Speaker needed</li>
  <li>Thursday 10/19: Speaker needed</li>
  <li>Tuesday 10/24: Speaker needed</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone is interested in speaking during those dates, feel free to contact me at lingo.13@osu.edu or by replying to this topic. I am looking forward to seeing the Opensource Club as strong as ever in the coming months, and these two events are a good way to start upon that road.</p>

<p>Welcome back for the 2006-2007 school year! Come and find out what we are planning for this year for the Opensource Club and share your thoughts and ideas. Would you like to see less talk and more rock? Then come and voice your opinion! We are especially interesting in your ideas for the upcoming Ohio LinuxFest 2006. Linuxfest is a free conference of over a dozen open-source sponsors and twenty speakers, all celebrating the greatness that in Linux and open source. This year, The Opensource Club will have its very own booth set up for the conference. We need to come up with ideas on how we can use this awesome opportunity to reach out to the greater Linux and open source community. Months ago I made the decision to use <a href="http://opensource.osu.edu/microwiki">Microwiki</a> as the base of our website, replacing the old HTML site that we had previously. At around the same time, <a href="http://freegeekcolumbus.org/">Freegeek Columbus</a> switched from <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> - the software that drives Wikipedia - to Mircowiki, and they seemed happy enough. It seemed a good choice for us. I thought that we should use something small and simple. Microwiki, weighing in at just 163 kilobytes, is undoubtably small and simple. However, as time wore on, it became clear that MicroWiki was not the best tool for the job. I pressed on, thinking that I could make it work. I never did. Here is a quick list of various problems I ran into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There were woefully few options, which at first I had thought a good idea, but it became obvious that this was a problem.</li>
  <li>There was no form of user management - unless you could phpMyAdmin.</li>
  <li>Current users could register new users. Eventually this broke, and new users had to be added through database tricks and magic.</li>
  <li>File/image upload never actually worked.</li>
  <li>External links and images could not be embeded with standard HTML. Wiki syntax <em>had</em> to be used.</li>
  <li>It was hard to theme. Different parts of the site were in different places, the CSS was hidden away in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few days ago I made the decision to kick Microwiki to the curb, and I haven’t looked back since. Here’s a short and sweet list of some new features this Drupal-based website can offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User management, including profiles, user roles, and access controls.</li>
  <li>Simpler editing tools. HTML!</li>
  <li>File uploads now work, and users can attach files to their stories and pages.</li>
  <li>Polls! What do you think about tax cuts for the upper tax bracket? Now we can find out!</li>
  <li>Extensibility, through hundreds of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules">modules</a>.</li>
  <li>Comments, with simple and powerful moderation.</li>
  <li>Easy theming. I made this theme by modifying the default Drupal theme with just CSS, in a file!</li>
</ul>

<p>That was just off the top of my head, and I think I will find many modules that will add great new features as time goes on. Enjoy the new site. It is not complete, I am about 95% of the way there. The last 5% is just tightening things up and changing some things here and there. Soon I will be posting information about <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest</a> and our participation, so be on the lookout for that soon. Feel free and register, and don’t hesitate to leave comments on what you think. – Alex</p>
