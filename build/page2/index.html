<p>Daniel “paradigm” Thau will present Bedrock Linux, a Linux distribution which
allows the use of software from a variety of typically mutually exclusive Linux
distributions, simultaneously and transparently.</p>

<p>If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL
clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo’s portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the
same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a means to
achieve this.</p>

<p>The presentation will cover the motivation behind the Bedrock Linux, various
real-world use cases for the project, concepts useful for utilizing and
understanding it, as well as future plans.</p>

<p>Laptops are encouraged, and as always there will be pizza.</p>

      <p>Level up this Thursday, 2016/03/10 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120 as Nikit
Malkan and William Osler present a talk on gaming with Linux. From free software
games like 0 A.D. and Super Tux Cart to proprietary games that run with a
compatibility layer, come learn about some of the essentials for getting the
most game out of your Linux system. We’ll also be covering details like how to
get set up and going in Wine, games you can run Linux servers for, game engines
with Linux support and more.</p>

<p>Also important this week, we’ll be having registration for club voting. We’re
changing up how voting is done for University compliance reasons. If you want to
be able to have a vote in future club leader or constitution changes, attending
this week’s meeting is super important.</p>

Matt Curtin, and his company Interhack Corporation, has addressed courts on the topics of wiretapping, data breaches, and more.

<p>This talk is targeted at the Vim user who is looking to take their knowledge of the editor to the next level. It can take several years to master a text editor in all it’s intricacies, and Vim is no exception. Having used Vim for the last four years or so, I will try to impart some of the lessons I have learned - not just about how to use Vim, but also about how to learn to use Vim. Some prior Vim experience will be beneficial.</p>

      <p>Thursday’s talk will be on installing Arch Linux, performed by our longtime
sysadmin William Osler. I also want to finalize a schedule for at least the next
couple weeks after gauging interest at last week’s meeting.</p>

<p>Many distributions like Ubuntu or Fedora are configured and set up with
out-of-the box programs and features. While this is very convenient, digging
deeper and setting up a system yourself will allow you to understand your system
and better customize it to your needs. Arch Linux is a distribution that makes
it easy to build your system up from a lightweight and simple base into an
operating system tailored to you. I’ll be covering everything from how to
install Arch using the Arch live image (there’s no installer, but I promise it’s
not scary!), to configuring your base system, working with packages, and
eventually building your way up to a desktop interface.</p>

<p>Redis is a nice (and fast!) alternative to using a database if the values you are trying to store are simple, and is commonly used for caching. The types that Redis natively supports are strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Additionally, Redis has other cool features such as a configurable level of on-disk persistence and “sentinels” for high availability. Redis is used widely by companies such as CoverMyMeds and was the persistence for the deceased IRC bot “spell,” and might be the perfect fit for your next project!</p>

Everyone at sometime or another has relied on their browser to store sensitive credentials quite often due to sheer simplicity. Did you know up until 2013 Chromium was storing a user’s credentials in PlainText.</p>

<p>Now if your the type that likes to use a password manager, you might already be aware that not all services are created equal. Just this Summer LastPass’ security was breached, exposing email accounts, encrypted master passwords, and password hints.</p>

<p>We will also discuss the lesser known solutions such as hardware encrypted HID devices. Just this year the Hack A Day community came together and designed/produced the Mooltipass, an open source hardware encrypted offline password manager.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to strike a comparable balance between convenience and security. The intention of this talk is to explore a wide variety of cross-platform solutions to secure your personal data.</p>

<p>I will talk about the different models of work flow, how source control plays a role, and then will talk extensively about <em>how</em> Git works. Following that, I will briefly cover how to use some basic Git commands and how to set it up quickly for the upcoming OHI/O 2015 hackathon. Plan on this meeting being slightly longer than usual as I want to ensure people will walk with a working knowledge of Git for the hackathon. Laptops are highly encouraged so you can follow along.
