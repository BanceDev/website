        <p>Join us this Thursday as Jon Arnett presents on Von Neumann machines and to say goodbye to our graduating seniors. The following is a brief excerpt on Von Neumann machines from Jon Arnett:</p>

<p>“Imagine a probe gliding through the galaxy. It lands on a planet, and begins to mine. After a while, it uses the materials it has collected to construct a replica of itself. The replica launches into space. The original probe sets off to explore its new found world, sending data back to Earth.</p>

<p>Imagine a nanobot breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of gas it must convert, it creates a replica to help it create a breathable atmosphere.</p>

<p>Imagine a world that’s gray. It undulates, slightly. If you were to take a microscope and look very closely (cautiously, though), you would see a teeming civilization of nanobots. They have overrun. They have eaten everything. They will eat you, too, if you get too close.</p>

<p>These are the promises and perils of Von Neumann (or Self-Replicating) machines. Join me for my exploration of this field, focusing on the history and theory of such machines.”</p>

        <p>Kevin Payravi from Wikipedia Connection will present on how to incorporate Wikipedia and its sister projects into your next project. The presentation will explore MediaWiki (the software behind Wikipedia), the MediaWiki API, machine learning and botting with Wikipedia, Wikidata (a free structured knowledgebase), and more. There will be an introduction to Tool Labs, Wikimedia’s free hosting environment for Wikimedia projects, as well as a look at some of the cool open source projects that have been developed for Wikipedia - which include vandalism-detecting bots, edit gamification, and making live music out of Wikipedia edits.</p>

<p>This presentation is an official HackOHI/O 2016 pre-hype event - we hope this presentation inspires you to make an awesome Wikimedia-related project at Ohio State’s annual hackathon!</p>

<p>Pretty Good Privacy(PGP) is a great way to communicate privately, but also to verify the identity of an online source. PGP is commonly used in fields such as journalism when identity is a must or when signing your code. PGP can also be used to encrypt communications so that only one party can read it.</p>

<p>Join us this Thursday, October 20, 2016, as Michael Yanovich describes the functionality of PGP and demonstrates how to use it. You’ll learn how to generate your own key, and have the opportunity to partake in a key signing party!</p>

<p>What started as a war is turning to a love affair. Over the last two decades, Microsoft has moved from a fierce opponent of the penguin to recently being welcomed by Ubuntu, Red Hat and others. Come for an interactive discussion of Microsoft’s journey with Open Source and see some demos of the new Bash on Windows and .Net Core.</p>

<p>Brian Sherwin is a Sr. Technical Evangelist with Microsoft from Columbus, Ohio. He has been a consultant and trainer for over 17 years. One of his core passions is helping companies make decisions based on value and not a particular technology. When he’s not trying to figure out some new technology, he spends time reading, Scouting, and drinking enough coffee to keep up with his five kids.</p>
