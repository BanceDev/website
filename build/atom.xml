The following is a brief excerpt on Von Neumann machines from Jon Arnett:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Imagine a probe gliding through the galaxy. It lands on a planet, and begins to mine. After a while, it uses the materials it has collected to construct a replica of itself. The replica launches into space. The original probe sets off to explore its new found world, sending data back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a nanobot breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of gas it must convert, it creates a replica to help it create a breathable atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world that’s gray. It undulates, slightly. If you were to take a microscope and look very closely (cautiously, though), you would see a teeming civilization of nanobots. They have overrun. They have eaten everything. They will eat you, too, if you get too close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the promises and perils of Von Neumann (or Self-Replicating) machines. Join me for my exploration of this field, focusing on the history and theory of such machines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always there will be pizza and laptops are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty Good Privacy(PGP) is a great way to communicate privately, but also to verify the identity of an online source. PGP is commonly used in fields such as journalism when identity is a must or when signing your code. PGP can also be used to encrypt communications so that only one party can read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us this Thursday, October 20, 2016, as Michael Yanovich describes the functionality of PGP and demonstrates how to use it. You’ll learn how to generate your own key, and have the opportunity to partake in a key signing party!&lt;/p&gt;
