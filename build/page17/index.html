      <p>On September 30, 2006 <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest 2006</a> will occur at the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/attend_travel.html">Greater Columbus Convention Center</a>. This event will draw over a dozen sponsors, twenty speakers, and nearly two-thousand attendees.</p>

<p>The Open Source Club is proud to once again play a part in an event which began on The Ohio State University campus. As a .org level sponsor, we will be attending and manning our own booth this year. We will draw up plans for our booth once the date draws closer. What is important now is for everyone who wished to attend to <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/attend.html">register</a> on the official Ohio LinuxFest 2006 website <strong>before Friday, September 22 2006</strong>. Registration is strictly limited to 1,968 attendees, so it is in your best interest to register <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>This year Ohio LinuxFest is offering two conference passes. The first option is the <em>Free Conference Pass</em>, which offers access to the presentations and expo. The second option is a new <em>All Conference Pass</em>, which in addition to the presentations and expo includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to the Conference Suite at the Holiday Inn</li>
  <li>Lunch on the Day of the Conference</li>
  <li>Drink tickets for the After Conference Party</li>
  <li>An Ohio Linuxfest T-Shirt</li>
  <li>Rockstar Style Backstage Pass</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of the All Conference Pass is $65.00, which goes only into defraying the cost of running Ohio LinuxFest.</p>

<p>You can find more information about Ohio LinuxFest 2006 on their <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">offical website</a>, including the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/speakers.html">List of speakers</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/schedule.html">conference schedule</a>.</p>

        <a href="/announcements/2006/09/21/new-drupal-based-website-launched/">New Drupal-based website launched</a>
      </h2>
    

    <span class="date">posted: 09-21-2006</span>

    
      <p>Months ago I made the decision to use Microwiki as the base of our website, replacing the old HTML site that we had previously. At around the same time, <a href="http://freegeekcolumbus.org/">Freegeek Columbus</a> switched from <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> - the software that drives Wikipedia - to Mircowiki, and they seemed happy enough. It seemed a good choice for us. I thought that we should use something small and simple. Microwiki, weighing in at just 163 kilobytes, is undoubtably small and simple. However, as time wore on, it became clear that MicroWiki was not the best tool for the job. I pressed on, thinking that I could make it work. I never did. Here is a quick list of various problems I ran into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There were woefully few options, which at first I had thought a good idea, but it became obvious that this was a problem.</li>
  <li>There was no form of user management - unless you could phpMyAdmin.</li>
  <li>Current users could register new users. Eventually this broke, and new users had to be added through database tricks and magic.</li>
  <li>File/image upload never actually worked.</li>
  <li>External links and images could not be embeded with standard HTML. Wiki syntax <em>had</em> to be used.</li>
  <li>It was hard to theme. Different parts of the site were in different places, the CSS was hidden away in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few days ago I made the decision to kick Microwiki to the curb, and I haven’t looked back since. Here’s a short and sweet list of some new features this Drupal-based website can offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User management, including profiles, user roles, and access controls.</li>
  <li>Simpler editing tools. HTML!</li>
  <li>File uploads now work, and users can attach files to their stories and pages.</li>
  <li>Polls! What do you think about tax cuts for the upper tax bracket? Now we can find out!</li>
  <li>Extensibility, through hundreds of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules">modules</a>.</li>
  <li>Comments, with simple and powerful moderation.</li>
  <li>Easy theming. I made this theme by modifying the default Drupal theme with just CSS, in a file!</li>
</ul>

<p>That was just off the top of my head, and I think I will find many modules that will add great new features as time goes on. Enjoy the new site. It is not complete, I am about 95% of the way there. The last 5% is just tightening things up and changing some things here and there. Soon I will be posting information about <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest</a> and our participation, so be on the lookout for that soon. Feel free and register, and don’t hesitate to leave comments on what you think.</p>

<p>– Alex</p>

      </h2>
    

    <span class="date">posted: 09-10-2006</span>

    
      <p>As part of our participation in the <a href="http://ohiounion.osu.edu/studentorgs/events_involvement.asp">Student Involvement Fair</a> and <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest 2006</a> I’d like to hand out pamphets that showcase who we are and our upcoming meetings. I’ve started work on it, and would appriciate any idea or comments you may have on it. You can download it at the bottom of the page in OpenDocument and PDF formats. Edit: The automatic uploader is not working, due to possible SELinux issues. I’ve linked to the files manually, and will look into the issue. Release notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is in greyscale, as color printed through SOURCE is more expensive.</li>
  <li>It is 3 2/3” x 8”, so three can be printed on a single sheet of 8” x 11” paper.</li>
  <li>
    <strike>Peter hasn't confirmed with me that he will give his talk on 10/19.</strike>
  </li>
  <li>Jim hasn’t decided on the topic of his talk, so I have put “Kitten Huffing” as a placeholder until he does.</li>
  <li>
    <strike>I'm going to rewrite the "Welcome Back!" text.</strike>
  </li>
  <li>Part of the open source description and the net neutrality description are taken from Wikipedia. I plan on rewriting the net neutrality copy, but like the open source description. If we use it, we will have to place a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.txt">GNU Free Documentation License</a> boilerplate at the bottom.</li>
  <li>The pamphlet will be updated for Ohio LinuxFest to remove references to previous meetings and to include information on more upcoming meetings.</li>
  <li>I’ve added a condensed form of Peter’s talk description.</li>
  <li>I’ve changed the size of the OSUOSS logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>For those who do not want to download the files, here is the complete text of the pamphlet:</p>

<p>A student and community organization dedicated to the idea of open source software. Open source software is computer software whose source code is available under a copyright license that permits users to study, change, and improve the software.</p>
